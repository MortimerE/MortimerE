- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MortimerE; welcome to my personal GitHub!
- I make software, music, and positive life choices (sometimes).
- I'm a student at Georgia Tech working on my master's of Computer Science
- I'm currently working on building my repos, as most of my work has been previously dedicated to academic or professional settings. 
- I'm interested in projects related to ML (especially computer vision & NLP), Blockchain, VR, Audio, Quantum Computing, and Sociopolitical & Environmental Causes
- Shoot me an email at emortimert@gmail.com if you'd like to connect about work!
